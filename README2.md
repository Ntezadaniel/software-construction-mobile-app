**Programming vs. Software Construction**

**Programming**: The act of writing code to solve a specific problem or implement an algorithm. It's the "bricks and mortar."
**Software Construction:** The holistic process of creating working software. This includes detailed design, coding, unit testing, debugging, and integration. It's the "building of the house."
